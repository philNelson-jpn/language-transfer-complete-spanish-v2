00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Hello and welcome to Complete Spanish.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.400
We’re really excited about this new material,

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.160
Language Transfer's first complete course,

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.920
which is all you need to become a master self-directed language learner

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.280
and steer yourself to fluency through practice of,

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.400
and exposure to,

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.160
Spanish;

8
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.800
enjoying the fascinating journey of delving into language.

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.440
Right after the first hour,

10
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.560
you will be and feel like a Spanish speaker.

11
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.920
With the thinking method,

12
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.120
we are not just interested in teaching you Spanish in record time,

13
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.880
but also about exploring the thinking processes,

14
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.600
abilities,

15
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.320
and habits which make us effective and confident language learners

16
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.880
in control of our own learning process.

17
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.240
This will give you a more intimate relationship with your new language

18
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.640
and the greater ability to express yourself through the mechanisms that language offers.

19
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.520
We will reconstruct the language together in a way

20
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.640
that will give you all of the know-how to overcome your technical difficulties in that language,

21
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.360
so that you can concentrate on achieving and enjoying a freedom in your new language.

22
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.080
The course has been recorded with a volunteer student

23
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.440
and is a genuine real life learning experience.

24
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.880
The volunteer student does not have a script,

25
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.560
and she’s not acting.

26
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.960
Recording in this way has allowed us to capture the essence of the learning experience with the thinking method.

27
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.480
During the length of the course,

28
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.760
I will be asking the volunteer student to perform various mental exercises,

29
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.360
resulting in the construction of sentences.

30
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.480
When I do so,

31
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.160
you will pause the audio and complete the task yourself,

32
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.000
and then continue listening to see how our volunteer student answered.

33
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.280
It is important to understand that these are exercises and not tests.

34
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.600
Do not rush to answer.

35
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.000
Take your time to think through your answer at your own pace,

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.920
building it up piece by piece with the instructions you received during the audio,

37
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.240
which are as much about the language as they are about the mental processes.

38
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.160
It is very important that you don’t try to memorize anything.

39
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.600
Memorization is an extremely distracting process,

40
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.000
and I need you 100% here with us.

41
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.080
If you need help getting over any anxiety about forgetting or the possibility of forgetting,

42
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.960
then just remind yourself that you can always repeat the course at the end.

43
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.600
So relax.

44
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.760
It’s also important that you don't write anything down.

45
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.640
You will carry around your new language in your head,

46
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.240
not in a notebook.

47
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.120
Some of the content you may forget,

48
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.880
and that’s ok.

49
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.520
That’s part of the design.

50
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.640
Don’t worry about that,

51
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.360
and just concentrate on understanding (not memorizing) the explanations

52
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.240
and building the sentences we give you.

53
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.160
Find the time and place to do the audios where you are calm,

54
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.000
undisturbed and can concentrate solely on your language learning experience.

55
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.880
Using headphones should help you to tune out from the outside world

56
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.840
and concentrate on this experience.

57
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.120
Try to be well rested when you do the courses.

58
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.240
The tired mind makes all kinds of unproductive short cuts and careless mistakes.

59
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.520
It is of the utmost importance that you don’t just listen to the audios,

60
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.480
even if you’re listening and understanding the process,

61
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.920
but that you pause every time I ask our volunteer student a question

62
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.160
and work it out for yourself before hearing her response.

63
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.920
Otherwise you will not have your own language learning experience -

64
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.160
you will just be witnessing somebody else’s.

65
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.160
If you do not pause and work out the answer for yourself before continuing,

66
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.080
you will finish knowing a lot about Spanish but not speaking Spanish.

67
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.480
Sometimes our student takes one second to reply;

68
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.040
sometimes 30 seconds or more.

69
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.520
What we’ve done in the editing process is to leave a short pause for you to hit the pause button

70
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.400
and then embark on your own mental journey before replying out loud and continuing with us.

71
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.800
The more energy you have,

72
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.360
the more information you will naturally assimilate.

73
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.600
If you find yourself tuning out during the explanations due to tiredness,

74
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.760
then take a break and go back to it later.

75
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.600
It’s better to do little often than a lot all at once.

76
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.600
So 20 minutes a day you will find much more effective than a few hours crammed in over the weekend.

77
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.240
But of course you will find your own balance with other commitments and how quickly you wish to learn Spanish.

78
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.720
If it’s been awhile since you’ve had to concentrate,

79
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.960
then don’t worry.

80
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.920
You will notice your concentration span increase very rapidly.

81
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.480
And remember: think slowly to learn quickly.

82
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.920
This isn’t at school where we expect your hand to go up straight away with the correct answer through memorization;

83
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.880
this is a different process where you are expected to take the time to think your answer through

84
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.200
and to appreciate and understand that it’s those very processes of taking that time

85
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.000
and thinking those answers through which makes us assimilate this new knowledge.

86
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.560
You don’t even have to worry about memorizing this advice,

87
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.040
because it will be revisited many times during the course.

88
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.240
Not only are all the courses at Language Transfer available for free download,

89
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.640
but we are also an unfunded and independent project.

90
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.400
This allows us to create the best courses we can create,

91
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.680
without external monetary or publicity pressures.

92
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.480
Now, to maintain this freedom and to continue with the many plans

93
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.720
we have in the pipeline for more audio courses and also textbooks,

94
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.000
we really do need help with donations.

95
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.960
So if you love the course and are in a position to donate,

96
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.640
then please do.

97
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.520
Many thanks for joining us,

98
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.080
and let’s begin.
